### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning in JLU
- 💬 中文是母语。English is generally OK.
- 📫 How to reach me: I prefer Github Issues [here](https://github.com/leviolet/leviolet/issues)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to mess up a senior's porject using pull request. So I prefer to use isuue or email instead of pull request to make contributions.
